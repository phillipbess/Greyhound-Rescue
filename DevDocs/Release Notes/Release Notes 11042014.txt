Notes on deploying to AWS  November 4, 2014

A few changes to create a war file that can be deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Connection to the DB was changed.  They recommend that the connection string be created at runtime using the environment variables that they created.  I don't know how to do that, so I hard coded the connection to the DB that they created.  This is in persistence.xml   They also named the databse ebdb without telling me.  
Connection to the database. 

I have the first from AWS and the second from persistence.xml:

aa4qn6mtxygpul.cifbuhops9dx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306/ebdb

<property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.url" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/gpago"/>

The name of the database is hardcoded in persistence.xml

==================================

tomcat-users.xml

In AWS we don't get direct access to tomcat, so we needed to add a folder in WebContent called

 .ebextensions     (ElasticBeanstalk)
server-update.config    - copies the tomcat-users file to the right place
tomcat-users.xml

====================================

We needed to add a folder called .ebextensions in WebContent.  

That is the only way I can figure out to push the tomcat-users.xml file into the deployment.  There is now 2 tomcat-users files.  :(

the users are now:
	<role rolename="petManager"/>
	<user username="Wendy" password="connor" roles="petManager"/>
	<user username="admin" password="gpago" roles="petManager"/>

the database master user/password is still    gpago / password

============================================

Added the file AwsCredentatils.properties in src. I think this might be only required if you want to deploy directly from Eclipse, but I'm not sure.  I'm deploying by exporting a WAR file and uploading that into AWS.
